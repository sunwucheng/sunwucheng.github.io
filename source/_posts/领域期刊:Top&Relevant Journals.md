The International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture is devoted to advances in scientific understanding of essential mechanics of processes and machines applied to the manufacture of engineering components, mainly in metals, but also in composites, ceramics and other structural/functional materials. To this end coverage is given to a range of topics that includes:

* Essential mechanics of processes involving material removal, accretion and deformation, in solid, semi-solid or particulate form
* Significant scientific development of existing or new processes and machines
* In-depth characterisation of workpiece materials (structure/surfaces) by advanced techniques (e.g. SEM, EDS, TEM, EBSD, AES, Raman spectroscopy) to reveal new phenomenological aspects that govern manufacturing processes
* Tool design, utilisation and in-depth studies of failure mechanisms
* Novel concepts of machine tools/fixtures/tool holders supported by modelling and demonstrations that are relevant to manufacturing processes within the journal's remit
* Novel scientific contributions dealing with interactions between the machine tool, control system, software design and processes.
* Studies of specific mechanisms governing niche processes (e.g. ultra-high precision, nano /atomic level manufacturing with either mechanical or non-mechanical "tools")
* Novel approaches, supported by adequate in-depth scientific analysis, addressing emerging /breakthrough processes (e.g. bio-inspired manufacturing) and/or applications (e.g. ultra-high precision optics)

The above list is not exhaustive and papers on other topics associated with process science/technology or manufacturing hardware are welcome. Significant and useful advance of the current state of knowledge is an essential factor and it is important that papers are presented in a manner that will be appreciated by both academics and practising engineers. It is unlikely that papers dealing with theory or modelling alone will be acceptable, unless a significant proven advance in scientific/technological knowledge is demonstrated. Likewise, papers in which the use of methodology predominates over technological advance would probably be rejected. Normally, multipart papers are not acceptable.

### [International Journal of Refractory Metals and Hard Materials](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-journal-of-refractory-metals-and-hard-materials)

<details>
<summary><mark>[CiteScore: 3.11; Impact Factor: 2.794]</mark> - Aims&Scope[en] (点击展开)</summary>
The International Journal of Refractory Metals and Hard Materials (IJRMHM) publishes original research articles concerned with all aspects of refractory metals and hard materials. Refractory metals are defined as metals with melting points higher than 1800 °C. These are tungsten, molybdenum, chromium, tantalum, niobium, hafnium, and rhenium, as well as many compounds and alloys based thereupon. Hard materials that are included in the scope of this journal are defined as materials with hardness values higher than 1000 kg/mm2, primarily intended for applications as manufacturing tools or wear resistant components in mechanical systems. Thus they encompass carbides, nitrides and borides of metals, and related compounds. A special focus of this journal is put on the family of hardmetals, which is also known as cemented tungsten carbide, and cermets which are based on titanium carbide and carbonitrides with or without a metal binder. Ceramics and superhard materials including diamond and cubic boron nitride may also be accepted provided the subject material is presented as hard materials as defined above.
The journal seeks contributions that investigate novel alloy design concepts; studies of the relationships between chemical composition, microstructure, and properties; novel methods of characterization and testing, novel methods of synthesis and processing, especially those that result in improved or novel microstructures, leading in turn to improved properties and novel applications. Articles focus on methods and processes that reduce material and energy consumption, hence the cost of these materials will also be considered.
The process technologies may include but are not limited to powder synthesis and production technologies (chemical methods, physical methods such as mechanical ball milling); powder compaction and shaping technologies including die compaction, powder injection molding, and 3D printing; and sintering and consolidation processes such as vacuum sintering, hot isostatic pressing, field assisted sintering, and other advanced hot consolidation techniques. However, manuscripts that focus on processes without a clear explanation on how the process can lead to improved microstructure and properties, or reduction of energy consumption and costs are likely discouraged.
This journal also publishes articles dealing with the deposition process and the microstructure and the measurement of selected properties of coatings, provided the coating consists of a material from the groups defined above, and is applied on the surface of a refractory metal or hard material. For eligibility of such articles the material science aspect of the coatings and if applicable their interrelationship with the properties of the coatings is of prime importance. Papers lacking this focus are usually referred to other journals dedicated to surface coating or machining.
IJRMHM aims to bridge the gap between pure research and the more practical aspects of production and properties. In that IJMHM will continue to provide a medium linking together material scientists, engineers, designers and manufacturers working in this field.

### [Wear](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/wear)

<details>
<summary><mark>[CiteScore: 3.35; Impact Factor: 2.95]</mark> - Aims&Scope[en] (点击展开)</summary>
Wear journal is dedicated to the advancement of basic and applied knowledge concerning the nature of wear of materials. Broadly, topics of interest range from development of fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of wear to innovative solutions to practical engineering problems. Authors of experimental studies are expected to comment on the repeatability of the data, and whenever possible, conduct multiple measurements under similar testing conditions. Further, Wear embraces the highest standards of professional ethics, and the detection of matching content, either in written or graphical form, from other publications by the current authors or by others, may result in rejection.
Submissions are invited on such subjects as:
(a) Wear modelling and validation. This includes modelling of fundamental mechanisms as well as the modelling of tribosystems. Approaches may employ contact mechanics, frictional considerations and lubrication concepts in the development of the model, and will always include physical validation of the model.
(b) The development and use of new wear testing methods and standards. This includes the rationale behind their development (including a critique of existing test methodologies where appropriate).
(c) New wear diagnostic tools. The need for these tools and examples of their use in either basic research or engineering should be illustrated.
(d) The development of wear-resistant materials, coatings, or surface treatments. Such papers should include, for example, benchmarking against materials currently employed in targeted engineering applications, or presenting a basic hypothesis underlying the work that can be validated as an advance over the current state-of-the-art. The criteria used to select the test methods employed (and the conditions under which those tests were conducted) must be robustly justified with regard to the targeted engineering applications. The proposed mechanisms of wear must be discussed in the context of data and observations that support those conclusions.
(e) Relationships between the composition, structure, properties, and processing of materials and their wear behavior. Such submissions should include the basic rationale for the work, its foundation in prior knowledge, and how the current approach is implemented to explore these relationships. The criteria used to select the tests or analytical methods employed shall be explained with respect to the purpose of the research, be it fundamental or applied.
(f) The role of lubricants or other interfacial species in the wear of materials. Such submissions will focus on the mechanisms of wear in the presence of well-characterized interfacial environments.
The Abstracts of all submissions, whether a full paper or a shorter communication, should summarize the purpose and approach to the given problem, indicate the materials under investigation, and present the primary conclusions in a brief and concise manner. Overt commercialism or product promotion is unacceptable. Submissions to Wear will be peer-reviewed to assess their archival quality, clarity of communication, and the novelty of their contributions to the science and technology of wear.
